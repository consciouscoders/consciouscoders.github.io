We, the [ConsciousCoders](http://consciouscoders.io/), are an independent and non-profit association of critical thinkers and makers. We are driven by the goal of discussing and shaping the impact of AI and digital technologies on society.

This blog is a platform for our workgroups. It is not meant to be a one way street, our articles are invitations to get in contact and discuss.

In early 2019, we will start with a series of posts that introduce the current state of the field: What are important terms and how can they be distinguished? How is the technology applied and what ethical issues arise from that? What is the current legal perspective? What norms exist? In the following posts, we develop a perspective on how ethical issues could be attacked. In a short essay we motivate how regulations could be used to help practitioners make ethical choices. Additionally, we study fairness in Machine Learning. A number of technological approaches exist to prevent discrimination in Machine Learning, but can they really fill the place of a public discourse?

We hope that you are curious to hear about our findings. To stay tuned, simply subscribe to our newsletter on [consciouscoders.io](http://consciouscoders.io/)!
