We, the [ConsciousCoders](http://consciouscoders.io/) are an independent and not for profit association of critical thinkers and makers driven by the goal to discuss and shape the impact of AI and digital technologies on society.

This blog is a platform for our workgroups. It is not meant to be a one way street, our articles are invitations to get in contact and discuss.

We will start in early 2019 with a series of posts that introduce to the current state of the field. What are important terms and how can they be distinguished? How is the technology applied and what ethical issues are derived from that? What is the current legal perspective? What norms are exist? In the following posts, we develop an perspective how ethical issues could be attacked. In a short essay we motivate how regulations could be used to help practitioners to make ethical choices. Additionally, we study fairness in ML. A number of technological approaches exist to prevent discrimination in ML, but can they really fill the place of a public discourse?
