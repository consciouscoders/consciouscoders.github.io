We, the [ConsciousCoders](http://consciouscoders.io/) are an independent and not for profit association of critical thinkers and makers driven by the goal to discuss and shape the impact of AI and digital technologies on society.

This blog is a platform for our workgroups. It is not meant to be a one way street, our articles are invitations to get in contact and discuss.

We will start in early 2019 with a series of posts that introduce to the current state of the field. What are important terms and how can they be distinguished? How is the technology applied and what ethical issues are derived from that? What is the current legal perspective? Having given an overview over the field, we develop an perspective how those problems could be attacked. In a short playdoer we assess how regulations could help. We are especially interested in existing norms and how they can be implemented. As an example the problem of Fairness in ML is introduced.

In our newsletter, we will notify you when we publish new articles. Stay tuned and get signed up on [consciouscoders.io](http://consciouscoders.io/).
